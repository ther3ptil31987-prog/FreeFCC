## Download

| Download | Link |
|----------|------|
| FreeFCC App (APK) | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/releases) or [freefcc.duckdns.org](https://freefcc.duckdns.org) |
| Helper Apps (zip) | [freefcc.duckdns.org/downloads/freefcc-helpers.zip](https://freefcc.duckdns.org/downloads/freefcc-helpers.zip) |

You need both. The helper apps let you sideload FreeFCC onto the RC2.

## Compatibility

**Only tested on the DJI RC2 controller.** For DJI RC Pro 2 or RC Plus controllers, use [freefcc-launcher](https://github.com/doesthings/freefcc-launcher) instead, since not all controllers can install APKs from a microSD card the way the RC2 does.

| Drone | Controller | FCC | 4G | LED | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| DJI Mini 5 Pro | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Yes | FCC + LED working |
| DJI Mini 4 Pro | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Neo 1 | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Neo 2 | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Avata 360 | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| Other RC2 aircraft | RC2 | Should work | Unknown | Unknown | FCC profile is universal |
| DJI RC Pro 2 / RC Plus | All | Use [freefcc-launcher](https://github.com/doesthings/freefcc-launcher) | - | - | Not tested with this app |

Tested on DJI RC 2 Remote Controller firmware v10.00.0700. Older firmware versions should also work, and future versions will likely continue to work unless DJI patches the DUMPL param write path.

If you test it on a model or firmware version not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/issues) and let me know.

## Install Guide

Tested on Mini 5 Pro with RC2, latest firmware. No PC needed.

The full guide with screenshots is on [freefcc.duckdns.org](https://freefcc.duckdns.org). Here's the short version:

### 1. Prep the SD card

Download the helper apps zip and the FreeFCC APK. Extract the zip, drop the APK into the extracted folder, then move the whole thing onto a microSD card. Stick the card into your RC2.

> The RC2 won't install apps from internal storage, only from the SD card.

### 2. Install the helper apps

Swipe down from the top of the RC2 screen, tap the SD card notification, hit EXPLORE, and open your folder. Install these two without opening them:

- `01_PackageInstaller` - tap it, CONTINUE, INSTALL, DONE
- `02_FileManager` - same thing

### 3. Restart

Hold the power button to shut down, then power back on. This registers the package installer.

### 4. Install the launcher

Back into your folder on the SD card. Install `03_ATVLauncher` but don't open it yet.

### 5. Set up Edge Gestures

Install `04_Edge Gestures` and this time tap OPEN. Follow the prompts and grant the Accessibility service permission. Then:

- Disable the left gesture, keep only the right side
- Scroll down to "Swipe to the left", tap it
- Pick Application, then choose ATV Launcher

Now swiping right-to-left on the screen opens the launcher.

### 6. Install FreeFCC

Swipe from the right edge to open ATV Launcher. Open the Files app, find your folder, tap `FREEFCC.apk`, and install it.

## How to Use

1. Power on the drone and link it to the controller
2. Open FreeFCC and tap **Connect**
3. Tap **Enable FCC Mode** and wait for the green checkmark
4. For 4G: tap **Turn 4G ON** (the drone needs to be connected so the app can read its serial number)
   > **Note:** 4G activation has not been tested on hardware yet. The frame format is based on the documented DUMPL protocol, but I have not confirmed it works in practice. If you try it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/issues) with the result.
5. To stop: tap **Stop FCC Mode** to restore CE
6. For LED: tap **LED ON** or **LED OFF** (requires DJI Fly running with aircraft connected)
7. The **Info** tab lets you query the controller's hardware and firmware version

## How Do I Know If It Worked?

Open the DJI Fly app and go to the Transmission tab. Look at the horizontal bar around -90 dBm:

- If it lines up with the **1km mark**, your drone is in **CE mode**
- If it falls **below** the 1km mark (extends further), your drone is in **FCC mode**

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>FCC Mode</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>CE Mode</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=".github/fcc.webp" alt="FCC mode"></td>
<td><img src=".github/ce.webp" alt="CE mode"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" style="color:#34D399">Signal extends past 1km</td>
<td align="center" style="color:#7A85A3">Signal barely reaches 1km</td>
</tr>
</table>

> If the signal graph hasn't changed, power cycle the controller and try again. Make sure the drone is powered on and linked before enabling FCC.

## How It Works

The app sends DUMPL commands to the controller's local TCP proxy at `127.0.0.1:40009`. DUMPL is DJI's internal command protocol, publicly documented in the [dji-firmware-tools](https://github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools) project.

Each command is a small binary packet with a magic byte (`0x55`), a header with sender and receiver info, a payload, and two CRC checksums. The app builds these packets from JSON profile files and sends them over TCP, one packet per connection.

### FCC Profile

21 frames sent in 2 rounds with 150ms between each frame. The sequence enters service mode, sets the radio region to FCC, writes channel groups and power limits, commits the change, and exits service mode. The same 21 frames work on every DJI aircraft model I tested.

One of the frames (frame 2) sends an Assistant Unlock command (cmd 0xDF) to the flight controller, which is required before any parameter write on modern DJI aircraft (WM330 and newer). Then frame 3 writes to the flight controller parameter `g_config.flying_limit.max_height_0` and sets it to 500 meters, and frame 4 writes `max_height_1` to the same value. This is the FCC regulatory altitude ceiling, which replaces the 120m CE limit. Without the Assistant Unlock command, the flight controller silently rejects the parameter write, which is why some users see FCC mode but still have a 120m altitude limit.

### 4G Profile

128 frames sent in a single round with 10ms between each. Each frame carries the aircraft's serial number in its payload. The serial is read from the controller at runtime by listening for telemetry on the DUMPL socket.

**How 4G activation works:**

Unlike FCC which goes through the standard DUMPL TCP proxy on port 40009, 4G frames are sent via a Unix domain socket at `/duss/mb/0x205` (abstract namespace). This is a separate DJI internal command bus that talks directly to the cellular/4G module. The app opens a new `LocalSocket` connection for each frame, writes the frame bytes, flushes, and closes. No ACK is read back since the 4G module does not respond on this socket.

The frame format is:
- `sender = 2` (CAMERA)
- `cmd_type = 0` (Request, NO_ACK_NEEDED, no encryption)
- `cmd_set = 81` (0x51, 4G command set)
- `cmd_id = 0..127` (sequential, one per frame)
- `dst = 238` (0xEE, OFDM_GROUND index 7)
- `payload = 000000 + ASCII(aircraft_serial)`

The aircraft serial is probed by listening on TCP port 40009 for telemetry data. The serial format is typically `1581XXXXXXXXXXX` (16-20 alphanumeric characters). If the full serial is not found, the app falls back to the shorter model code pattern `W[AM]xxx`.

4G activation requires a DJI Cellular Dongle 2 to be physically connected to the aircraft. Without the dongle, the Unix socket `/duss/mb/0x205` will not exist and the frames will fail to send.

### Profile Format

Profiles are JSON files in `app/src/main/assets/profiles/`. Each frame looks like this:

```json
{ "s": 16, "i": 88, "d": 18, "p": "030100", "note": "Enter service mode" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `s` | Command set (16 = service mode, 6 = radio, 3 = flight controller) |
| `i` | Command ID within the set |
| `d` | Destination device |
| `p` | Payload as hex string (sent as raw bytes, no transformation) |
| `note` | Plain English description of what the frame does |

You can open these files in any text editor, read every byte that gets sent, and modify them if you want.

### How the Frames Were Obtained

The DUMPL proxy on DJI controllers listens on `127.0.0.1:40009` and accepts plain unencrypted TCP connections. The command frames were identified by capturing loopback traffic on the controller while the radio was active, then extracting the `0x55`-prefixed DUMPL packets from the capture:

```bash
tcpdump -i lo -w /sdcard/capture.pcap port 40009
```

The frames are plaintext on the local socket with no encryption. Once captured, the payloads were decoded using the publicly documented command set and device type enums from the [dji-firmware-tools](https://github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools) project (GPL-3.0). This project's `DumplBuilder` class implements the same CRC-8 (polynomial 0x8C, init 0x77) and CRC-16 (polynomial 0x1021, init 0x3692) as the reference implementation to build valid frames from the decoded command definitions.
