## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **FCC Unlock** | Switches the radio from CE to FCC mode for higher power and more channels |
| **4G Activation** | Sends 4G activation frames to the aircraft (serial read at runtime) — no status readback, experimental |
| **LED Control** | Turn aircraft arm LEDs on or off (requires DJI Fly running with aircraft connected) |
| **Device Info** | Queries the controller for hardware and firmware version |
| **Auto-FCC** | Toggle to automatically connect and apply FCC every time the app opens |
| **Auto-Updater** | Checks GitHub for new releases and lets you download/install from the app |
| **Offline** | Everything runs locally. No internet, no server, no tracking (except update check) |
| **Open Profiles** | Command frames are plain JSON files you can inspect and edit |
| **No License** | No activation, no trial, no tracking, no server contact |

> **Note on altitude/distance/NFZ unlock:** This is **not possible** via DUML commands alone. The 120m CE altitude limit is enforced by the **DJI Fly app** via a C0 class runtime flag that overrides flight controller parameters on every connection. No FCC unlock app can bypass this — it requires modifying the DJI Fly app itself or flashing patched firmware. DUML parameter writes set the FC values, but the Fly app overrides them. There is no known way to bypass this without modifying the DJI Fly app or flashing patched firmware.

## Download

| Download | Link |
|----------|------|
| FreeFCC App (APK) | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/releases) or [freefcc.duckdns.org](https://freefcc.duckdns.org) |
| Helper Apps (zip) | [freefcc.duckdns.org/downloads/freefcc-helpers.zip](https://freefcc.duckdns.org/downloads/freefcc-helpers.zip) |

You need both. The helper apps let you sideload FreeFCC onto the RC2.

## Compatibility

**Tested on DJI RC2 and RC Pro 2.** The app installs directly on both controllers — no special launcher needed for FCC mode. The [freefcc-launcher](https://github.com/doesthings/freefcc-launcher) is only needed if you want 4G support on RC Pro 2 / RC Plus.

| Drone | Controller | FCC | 4G | LED | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| DJI Mini 5 Pro | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Yes | FCC + LED working |
| DJI Mini 4 Pro | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Mavic 4 Pro | RC Pro 2 | Yes | Use launcher | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Air 3S | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Neo 1 | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Neo 2 | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Avata 360 | RC2 | Yes | Not tested | Not tested | FCC working |
| Other RC2 aircraft | RC2 | Should work | Unknown | Unknown | FCC profile is universal |
| RC Pro 2 / RC Plus | All | Direct install | Use [freefcc-launcher](https://github.com/doesthings/freefcc-launcher) for 4G | - | FCC works without launcher |

Tested on DJI RC 2 firmware v10.00.0700 and DJI RC Pro 2. Older firmware versions should also work, and future versions will likely continue to work unless DJI patches the DUML param write path.

If you test it on a model or firmware version not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/issues) and let me know.

## Install Guide

Tested on Mini 5 Pro with RC2, latest firmware. No PC needed.

The full guide with screenshots is on [freefcc.duckdns.org](https://freefcc.duckdns.org). Here's the short version:

### 1. Prep the SD card

**Format the microSD card in the RC2 first.** Insert the card into the controller, then go to the RC2's storage settings and format it. If you skip this, the RC2 won't let you browse files on the card.

Download the helper apps zip and the FreeFCC APK. Extract the zip, drop the APK into the extracted folder, then move the whole thing onto the microSD card. Stick the card into your RC2.

> The RC2 won't install apps from internal storage, only from the SD card. The card must be formatted in the controller itself before it can be browsed.

### 2. Install the helper apps

Swipe down from the top of the RC2 screen, tap the SD card notification, hit EXPLORE, and open your folder. Install these two without opening them:

- `01_PackageInstaller` - tap it, CONTINUE, INSTALL, DONE
- `02_FileManager` - same thing

### 3. Restart

Hold the power button to shut down, then power back on. This registers the package installer.

### 4. Install the launcher

Back into your folder on the SD card. Install `03_ATVLauncher` but don't open it yet.

### 5. Set up Edge Gestures

Install `04_Edge Gestures` and this time tap OPEN. Follow the prompts and grant the Accessibility service permission. Then:

- Disable the left gesture, keep only the right side
- Scroll down to "Swipe to the left", tap it
- Pick Application, then choose ATV Launcher

Now swiping right-to-left on the screen opens the launcher.

### 6. Install FreeFCC

Swipe from the right edge to open ATV Launcher. Open the Files app, find your folder, tap `FREEFCC.apk`, and install it.

## How to Use

1. Power on the drone and link it to the controller
2. Open FreeFCC and tap **Connect**
3. Tap **Enable FCC Mode** and wait for the green checkmark
4. For 4G: tap **Send 4G Activation Frames** (the drone needs to be connected so the app can read its serial number). The app only confirms all frames were written successfully — it cannot confirm the aircraft activated 4G, since the socket doesn't respond. Check the DJI Fly app or the Cellular Dongle itself.
   > **Note:** 4G activation has not been tested on hardware yet. The frame format is based on the documented DUML protocol, but I have not confirmed it works in practice. If you try it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/issues) with the result.
5. To stop: tap **Stop FCC Mode** to restore CE
6. For LED: tap **LED ON** or **LED OFF** (requires DJI Fly running with aircraft connected)
7. The **Info** tab lets you query the controller's hardware and firmware version

## How Do I Know If It Worked?

Open the DJI Fly app and go to the Transmission tab. Look at the horizontal bar around -90 dBm:

- If it lines up with the **1km mark**, your drone is in **CE mode**
- If it falls **below** the 1km mark (extends further), your drone is in **FCC mode**

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>FCC Mode</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>CE Mode</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=".github/fcc.webp" alt="FCC mode"></td>
<td><img src=".github/ce.webp" alt="CE mode"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" style="color:#34D399">Signal extends past 1km</td>
<td align="center" style="color:#7A85A3">Signal barely reaches 1km</td>
</tr>
</table>

> If the signal graph hasn't changed, power cycle the controller and try again. Make sure the drone is powered on and linked before enabling FCC.

## How It Works

The app sends DUML commands to the controller's local TCP proxy at `127.0.0.1:40009`. DUML is DJI's internal command protocol, publicly documented in the [dji-firmware-tools](https://github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools) project.

Each command is a small binary packet with a magic byte (`0x55`), a header with sender and receiver info, a payload, and two CRC checksums. The app builds these packets from JSON profile files and sends them over TCP, one packet per connection.

### FCC Profile

21 frames sent in 2 rounds with 150ms between each frame. The sequence enters service mode, sets the radio region to FCC, writes channel groups and power limits, commits the change, and exits service mode. The same 21 frames work on every DJI aircraft model I tested.

One of the frames (frame 2) sends an Assistant Unlock command (cmd 0xDF) to the flight controller, which is required before any parameter write on modern DJI aircraft (WM330 and newer). Then frame 3 writes to the flight controller parameter `g_config.flying_limit.max_height_0` and sets it to 500 meters, and frame 4 writes `max_height_1` to the same value. This is the FCC regulatory altitude ceiling, which replaces the 120m CE limit. Without the Assistant Unlock command, the flight controller silently rejects the parameter write, which is why some users see FCC mode but still have a 120m altitude limit.

### 4G Profile

128 frames sent in a single round with 10ms between each. Each frame carries the aircraft's serial number in its payload. The serial is read from the controller at runtime by listening for telemetry on the DUML socket.

**How the 4G activation frames are sent:**

Unlike FCC which goes through the standard DUML TCP proxy on port 40009, 4G frames are sent via a Unix domain socket at `/duss/mb/0x205` (abstract namespace). This is a separate DJI internal command bus that talks directly to the cellular/4G module. The app opens a new `LocalSocket` connection for each frame, writes the frame bytes, flushes, and closes. No ACK is read back since the 4G module does not respond on this socket — the app can only confirm the frames were written, never that the aircraft actually activated 4G.

The frame format is:
- `sender = 2` (CAMERA)
- `cmd_type = 0` (Request, NO_ACK_NEEDED, no encryption)
- `cmd_set = 81` (0x51, 4G command set)
- `cmd_id = 0..127` (sequential, one per frame)
- `dst = 238` (0xEE, OFDM_GROUND index 7)
- `payload = 000000 + ASCII(aircraft_serial)`

The aircraft serial is probed by listening on TCP port 40009 for telemetry data. The serial format is typically `1581XXXXXXXXXXX` (16-20 alphanumeric characters). If the full serial is not found, the app falls back to the shorter model code pattern `W[AM]xxx`.

4G activation requires a DJI Cellular Dongle 2 to be physically connected to the aircraft. Without the dongle, the Unix socket `/duss/mb/0x205` will not exist and the frames will fail to send.

### Profile Format

Profiles are JSON files in `app/src/main/assets/profiles/`. Each frame looks like this:

```json
{ "s": 16, "i": 88, "d": 18, "p": "030100", "note": "Enter service mode" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `s` | Command set (16 = service mode, 6 = radio, 3 = flight controller) |
| `i` | Command ID within the set |
| `d` | Destination device |
| `p` | Payload as hex string (sent as raw bytes, no transformation) |
| `note` | Plain English description of what the frame does |

You can open these files in any text editor, read every byte that gets sent, and modify them if you want.

### How the Frames Were Obtained

The DUML proxy on DJI controllers listens on `127.0.0.1:40009` and accepts plain unencrypted TCP connections. The command frames were identified by capturing loopback traffic on the controller while the radio was active, then extracting the `0x55`-prefixed DUML packets from the capture:

```bash
tcpdump -i lo -w /sdcard/capture.pcap port 40009
```

The frames are plaintext on the local socket with no encryption. Once captured, the payloads were decoded using the publicly documented command set and device type enums from the [dji-firmware-tools](https://github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools) project (GPL-3.0). This project's `DumlBuilder` class implements the same CRC-8 (polynomial 0x8C, init 0x77) and CRC-16 (polynomial 0x1021, init 0x3692) as the reference implementation to build valid frames from the decoded command definitions.

## Building

Requirements: Java 17+, Android SDK 35.

### Windows

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.18.8-hotspot"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"

cd C:\projects\fcc_opensource
java -classpath gradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

cd /path/to/FreeFCC
./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

Run the unit tests with `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`.

### Release signing

Release builds are **unsigned** by default. To produce a signed release APK, create a keystore and a local `keystore.properties` file (gitignored) pointing at it:

1. Generate a keystore (one-time):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release
   ```
2. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill in your keystore path and passwords.
3. Run `./gradlew assembleRelease` — the build picks up `keystore.properties` automatically and signs the APK.

CI builds can sign via repository secrets instead of the local file: set `SIGNING_STORE_FILE`, `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD`, `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS`, `SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` (and `SIGNING_KEYSTORE_B64` as a base64-encoded keystore) in GitHub Actions.

> **Important:** Previous releases (v1.4.01 and earlier) were signed with Android's shared debug certificate. This has been fixed — release builds no longer fall back to the debug key. If you installed an older debug-signed APK, you will need to uninstall it before installing an APK signed with a new key.
